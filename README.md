## Inovasi360

The Inovasi360 Application Project involves the development of the Inovasi360 company profile website, serving as the primary platform to introduce the company to potential partners and customers. The website is carefully designed to convey comprehensive information about the companyâ€™s products, portfolio, history, company story, career opportunities, and other relevant details through the "About Us" page. Additionally, the website offers opportunities for individuals or entities interested in collaborating with the company through the "Let's Get Collab" page. In this project, the website's design and layout have been predefined, so the main focus is on data integration using the existing WordPress Content Management System (CMS).
